# covid_graphicator  
COVID-19 cases and deaths graphicator with matplotlib  
This was the final project of a Python course I took from ITBA.  
I developed it with a friend of mine, Lucas Ca√±as.  

<br><br/>
## How to run it  
You can run it in your terminal by calling `python covid_graphicator.py` while you are in the same directory.  

<br><br/>
### Considerations  
You need the python libraries NumPy, matplotlib and pandas.  
Feel free to suggest or ask me anything!
